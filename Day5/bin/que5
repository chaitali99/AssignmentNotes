Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a Thread?
Ans:
	Thread class:
		1. Thread class is a class.
		2. Thread class can be used to create a thread.
		3. Thread class has multiple method such as 'start' and 'run'.
		4. Thread class requires more memory space.
		5. Since multiple inheritance is not allowed in java, hence after a class 
		   extends the thread class,it can't extend to eny other class.
		6. Every thread creates a unique object and associates with it.
	
	Runnable Interface:
		1.Runnable interface is a functional interface.
		2. It can be used to create a thread.
		3.It has a single abstract method 'run'.
		4.It requires less memory space.
		5.when a class implements the 'runnable' interface, the class can extend to other classes.
		6.multiple threads can share the same objects.
