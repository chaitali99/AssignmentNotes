Q2) What are the benefits of using Multithreading?
Ans:

	1.Improved throughput. Many concurrent compute operations and I/O request within a single process.
	2.Simultaneous and fully symmetric use of multiple processors for computation and I/O
	3.Superior application responsiveness.If a request can be launched on its own thread, applications do not freeze or show the
	"hourglass". An entire application will not block, or otherwise wait,pending the completion of another requset
	4.Improved server responsiveness.Large or complex requests or slow clients don't block other requests for serbice. The overall
	  throghput of the server is much greater.
	5.Minimized system resource usage.Threads require less overhead to create, maintain,and manage than a traditional process.
	6.Program structure simplification.Threads can be used to simplify the structure of complex applications,such as server-class 
	and multimedia applications.Simple routines can be written for each activity, making complex programs easier to design and code
	and more adaptive to a wide variation in user demands.
	7.Better communication.Thread synchronization functions can be used to provide enhanced process-to-process communication.
