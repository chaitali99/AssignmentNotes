Q1.What do you mean by multithreading? why is it important?
Ans:
	Multithreading allows the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time.These parts
	are known as threads and are lightweight processes available within the process. So multithreading 
	leads to maximum utilizayion of the CPU by multitasking.
	
	Importance:
		Multithreading saves time as you can perform multiple operation together. The threads are 
		independent, so it does not block the user to perform multiple operations at the same 
		time and also, if an exception occurs in a single thread it does not affect any other threads.
