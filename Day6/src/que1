Q1/ What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?
Ans: 
		1.Synchronized method provides a lock corresponding to class level or object level.
		whereas Synchronized block provides lock on any object depending on the parameter.
		
		2.Synchronized method imposes lock on entire functionality of the respective method.
		while the synchronized block is used to lock a lesser number of consecutive statement
		
		3.The synchronized method provides lock on current instance otherwise class level therefore 
		nullPointerException can't excepted.On other hand if the parameter evaluated as null then there would
		be likely a nullPointer Exception occure.
		
		4.Synchronized block boosts the performance of a respective program as it is intended touse on an 
		only certain part of the program rather than the entire method whereas the synchronized method 
		locks entire functionality even though some part of code has nothing to do with write or update.
		
		5.Performance has an indirect relation with waiting time.In other words the synchronized method
		increases the waiting time, whereas synchronized block has an advantage over the method as its 
		scope is limited and smaller than the method
